## Direct answer (what is Content OS?)

${SITE_DESCRIPTION}

Content OS is a free web application for founders, engineers, and creators who want **signal over noise**: discover topics from Hacker News, Instagram, Reddit, RSS, and GitHub; rank them against a personal knowledge base; draft posts in your own voice; and publish manually with **no auto-posting**.

## Primary value proposition

- **From discovery to draft on your terms** - one workflow from topic board to finished draft
- **Grounded in you** - not generic AI; your writing style, interests, and perspective drive ranking and drafts
- **Completely free** - no subscription; optional bring-your-own-keys (BYOK) for AI and discovery APIs
- **Your control** - humans approve every word; Content OS never posts to social media on your behalf

## Who it is for

Founders building in public, engineers sharing technical insights, content creators, students, finance professionals, and anyone building a consistent personal brand without endless feed scrolling.

## Pricing and API keys
